                    <p>
                        The ultimate goal and purpose at Helios is to prepare its student population to emerge as independently as possible 
                        to meet the challenges of community life. Our curriculum is a customizable educational tool that adapts to the various 
                        abilities of each student. It incorporates visual cues and teaching based on applied behavior analysis to facilitate the 
                        learning capability of our children and thus enhance results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Helios also offers enrichment programs in order to supplement the educational process. 
                        These activities enhance learning and have been proven to assist children with Autism to learn to self regulate, 
                        engage in relaxation techniques, exhaust energy, concentrate, and many more areas that facilitate learning.

                        <li>Robotic and chess programs – verified research supports the concept that robotics and chess are applications 
                            that stimulate the neurons that are needed for autistic children to excel in science and math.

                         <br>
                         Educational standards are the learning goals for what students should know and be able to do at each grade level. 
                         Education standards, like Common Core are not a curriculum. At Helios we use Houghton Mifflin Harcourt® for our 
                         curriculum development. In other words, the Common Core is what students need to know and be able to do, and curriculum 
                         is how students will learn it. The Common Core State Standards are educational standards for English language arts 
                         (ELA)/literacy and mathematics in grades <u>K-12</u>. In addition, we also use The Unique Learning Curriculum which is also 
                         aligned with State Standards.

                    <p>
                        The curriculum is divided into eight areas which contribute to the development of the key skills, 
                        both academic and personal in order to be successful

                                Everything we know about the universe, from how trees reproduce to what an atom is made up of is the result of scientific 
                                research and experiment.

                                important because they are the “building blocks” or foundation movements for more complex and specialised skills.
