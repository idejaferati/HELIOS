                              Leadership is not about a title or a designation. It’s about impact, influence, and inspiration. Impact involves getting results, influence is about spreading the passion you have for your work, and you have to inspire team-mates. Without a doubt, Dr. Niyati Chitkara, Principal of Chitkara International School is the most scrupulous leader as it is under her tutelage that every day thousands of minds are inspired and educated. 
                              She is indeed a

                              personification of leadership as she believes in assimilating a powerful value system in the students along with focusing on their academic and co-curricular excellence. For the overall development of the students, she has worked hard to open varied promenades for trailing perfection in talent areas, like Visual & Performing Arts, Sports & Games, and Life Skills, etc. Thus it is in the honour of this distinction that Dr. Chitkara was bestowed with the title ‘Principal Par Excellence’ by leading International Institute of Hotel Management (IIHM).

                         <p>A teacher is one of the individuals who play a significant role in shaping the future of a child. Teachers are indeed instrumental in community building and helping to make a better society through their inspirational teachings. We are excited to share that Chitkara International School’s founding member, Ms. Kiran, Academic cum Hindi Coordinator, was conferred with ‘Teachers’ Day Award 2019’ by pioneering International Institute of Hotel Management (IIHM). Ms. Kiran was recognised and applauded for being an edifying torchbearer.
                              The IIHM Teachers Day Awards 2019 is a unique initiative by the International Hospitality Council, London & Delhi and International Institute of Hotel Management. Over the last 5 years, the event has become most sought after and popular among the educators of the country and is now India’s biggest award. This award certainly merits and symbolises the conscientious Teaching fraternity of Chitkara International School.

                         <li>Helios has always focused on investing in the future of children through programs that deck them with skills and tools. One of such initiatives was the exchange program titled “Partnership Between School”. This programme was a collaboration between Government Model Senior Secondary School, Dhanas and Chitkara International School. The discernible benefits of this collaboration included capacity building, sharing of ideas, innovative approach, etc. and the entire journey embarked upon resulted in a great learning and networking experience. This profuse association was applauded by Chandigarh Commission for Protection of Child Rights (CCPCR) at their event “National Consultation of UT’s on Creating Child-Friendly Cities” conducted on its 5th Foundation Day.</li>

                         The HELIOS School does not claim credit for the extraordinary achievements and
                         successes of our students, as those successes are the result of their extraordinary intellectual
                         potential and their hard work. The HELIOS School promotes the extraordinary achievements and 
                         successes of students in order to motivate them and at the same time raise public awareness of the
                         extraordinary potential of autisitic people and their importance, and thus create the most supportive
                         environment for them in our society.
