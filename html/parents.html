                            " Helios Autism is a wonderful school that my daughter has the privilege of attending.
                            Their emphasis is always on the welfare of the child not the curriculum unlike some
                            other schools/organizations. Helios demostrates a unique understanding of this growing
                            population. Their commitment to learning is a wonderfully evolving philosophy that they
                            actually make a reality instead of just talking about it. And as a parent, I can only
                            say I am thrilled that my child has the opportunity to be a part of it."

                            " I have been a parent of a Helios student for 7 years and they are continually impressing
                            me every year. Their curriculum has been modified to my child's needs and has past every
                            expectation and more that i want from a school. They have been able to coordinate his 
                            therapies through out the school day which alleviate extra stress on my son and me. I look
                            forward to the many more accomplishments Helios will achieve through out my sons time at 
                            the school."

                         every morning. I recommend this school to other parents looking for a safe and nurturing place 
                         to have their special needs."

                       did prior to putting him in the school, it felt as if it were too good to be true! But it's not!
                       Everyday he goes to school in Helios is a blessing. this school has filled our hearts with hope!
                       you will find that everyone in Helios is ther because it's their passion in wanting to make a 
                       difference! And they have, in our lives! I will be firever greatfull for this gem of a school. "

                         " When my son has been diagnosed with autism over a year ago i had no idea what to expect or 
                         what to do because autism was something I read about and heard about but never truly understood.
                         And when it came to my son I wanted the best school, the best teachers and the best therapists
                         to help him reach his highest potential - that's when I began my research. I went to visit schools 
                         and none of them really made an impact on me, they were over crowded and I didn't feel a personal
                         connection in any of them. Then I found Helios and right away I emailed them and asked a million 
                         questions and Mrs.***** always replied! We set up a tour of the school and I was shown around and 
                         when I met the principal I knew I had found the right place for my son. When she spoke to me about 
                         the school I felt her passion behind all her words and I automatically signed him up! Words cannot 
                         explain how grateful I am thatmy son continues to suprise me every single day and I honestly owe it
                         to this school & its amazing staff & the amazing curriculum that engages all the children in the way
                         that is best for them. "
