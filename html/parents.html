                            " Helios Autism is a wonderful school that my daughter has the privilege of attending.
                            Their emphasis is always on the welfare of the child not the curriculum unlike some
                            other schools/organizations. Helios demostrates a unique understanding of this growing
                            population. Their commitment to learning is a wonderfully evolving philosophy that they
                            actually make a reality instead of just talking about it. And as a parent, I can only
                            say I am thrilled that my child has the opportunity to be a part of it."

                            forward to the many more accomplishments Helios will achieve through out my sons time at

                              " When my son has been diagnosed with autism over a year ago i had no idea what to expect or 
                              what to do because autism was something I read about and heard about but never truly understood.
                              And when it came to my son I wanted the best school, the best teachers and the best therapists
                              to help him reach his highest potential - that's when I began my research. I went to visit schools 
                              and none of them really made an impact on me, they were over crowded and I didn't feel a personal
                              connection in any of them. Then I found Helios and right away I emailed them and asked a million 
                              questions and <mark>Mrs.*****</mark> always replied! We set up a tour of the school and I was shown around and 
                              when I met the principal I knew I had found the right place for my son. When she spoke to me about 
                              the school I felt her passion behind all her words and I automatically signed him up! Words cannot 
                              explain how grateful I am thatmy son continues to suprise me every single day and I honestly owe it
                              to this school & its amazing staff & the amazing curriculum that engages all the children in the way
                              that is best for them. "
